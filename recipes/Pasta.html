    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>Pasta: Use any pasta of your choice. Short Pasta works best like shells, elbows, bow ties, and so on.</li>
        <li>Lean ground beef: I used 90% Lean but you may use 80-85%</li>
        <li>Seasonings: onion powder, sweet paprika, dried mint, Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Tomato paste: some recipes didn’t call for tomato paste, but I loved the addition.</li>
        <li>Yellow or white sweet onions</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter: The original recipe for the sauce to be drizzled over the pasta is made with butter. I assume you can make it with just olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mild pepper paste: This is found at almost every Middle Eastern market, and I use it a lot in my cooking. Whether you use a Turkish pepper paste or any pepper paste at the store, it should yield the same great flavor.</li>
        <li>Turkish chili flakes, or regular chili flakes: I used normal chili flakes and wasn’t going to go hunting for Turkish chili. Lol.</li>
        <li>Greek yogurt or plain yogurt: You can use plain or Greek.</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Minced parsley</li>
        <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li></ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>1. To make the lamb pasta, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Once hot, add the lamb mince and fry until browned then add the garlic, tomato purée, spices, dried thyme and a pinch of salt and stir to combine. Pour in the lamb stock, reduce the heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes.</p>

    <p>2. Meanwhile, to make the chilli butter, heat the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium heat until it starts to brown. Stir in the pul biber and chilli flakes then remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
        
    <p>3. To make the garlic yoghurt, mix the yoghurt and garlic together in a small bowl.</p>
        
    <p>4. To finish the lamb pasta, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, then add the paccheri and cook according to packet instructions. Drain.</p>
        
    <p>5. To serve, mix the paccheri with the chilli butter and spoon into a serving dish. Spoon over the garlic yoghurt then add the meat along with any resting juices. Garnish with the tomato and fresh herbs and serve.</p>
